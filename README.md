# Damage Incorporated

Damage Incorporated is a mod that adds many individual game rules which lets you control specific parts of the mobGriefing game rule. With currently 34 game rules implemented and many of them having extra configurability, you can safely disable one thing that's disabled by mobGriefing (like creeper explosions) without worrying about disabling everything else!
